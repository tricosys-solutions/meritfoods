      <p>A lot of people in Viman Nagar are avid nature lovers. Some are knowledgeable about birds, while others know a lot about trees and yet others have a lot of information about insects and other fauna. In short, most are aware about their environment to some extent. And perhaps, thatâ€™s where their involvement with the environment ends. They are aware about the denizens of the jungles and forests but are unaware about the natural wealth in their neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>What if they had a platform where they could share their knowledge with other like-minded nature lovers? What if they could inculcate an interest about the environment in others who go on with their lives blissfully unaware about their biodiversity?</p>
      <p>And so was born the concept of Sundara Vasundhara! A window to your local biodiversity!</p>
      <p>Sundara Vasundhara aims to be a platform and a regular event where everybody comes together and shares information about the biodiversity of the area they live in. This could be information such as a new winged visitor to the area or a unique species of a tree in the area, and so on. Come, be a part of this unique, citizen-led initiative that showcases the biodiversity of an area.</p>
      <p>Sundara Vasundhara 2010 was held from August 13-15, 2010 at Lunkad SkyMax in Viman Nagar and aimed to make people aware about environment-friendly products, organic food and how to grow them in their own homes, scientific toys made from recycled or waste materials, and a show to raise awareness about snakes.</p>
